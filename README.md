# URSM-master_edited
A re-edited python3 version of https://github.com/lingxuez/URSM

This pilot script is just for research
### Add mtx support
### Just use imputed mtx as output
### Remove K(cluster) manual input and use input cell type file to detect it automatically
Begin with editing `run_scunif.sh`

A trivial contribution, thank you :)
